# Com-sci-Culm
  We were tasked with making an application for our com sci culminating activity. So we did. We decided that a game would be best due to the party members intrest in them. We decided on the theme of Warhammer 40k for our game. for those who dont know, warhammer 40k is bassically a religous yet advanced group of humans who travel through space with the goal to unite all of humanity because in the past humans ventured out and are now sparcely populated throughout the universe. In simplest terms we chose a space based, platformer, shoot-em-up stlye game. We were allowed to use 2 AI prompts thatare no longer than 100 words to get the skeleton code for our game. We were very succseful in getting a rough but running version of our game. In terms of what we plan on adding; a login prompt, leader board, death screen, proper sprites for everything. Since Ai added most of the features we were looking for there is really not much else we could add other than fixing some bugs.
